# Networks Details

This page provides basic reference to Cardano EVM sidechain networks including RPC, chainId, and public utilities. The Cardano EVM sidechain testnet, Atago, replicates the Cardano EVM sidechain mainnet and is intended for testing purposes. Building on the testnet allows developers to deploy and test applications without risking real assets and value.

The Cardano sidechains toolkit supports three development environments
- [Remix](#remix)
- [Hardhat](#hardhat)
- [Truffle](#truffle)

# Remix

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a solidity smart contract to the EVM sidechain testnet using Remix. [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online IDE to develop and deploy Solidity smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

In this tutorial, you will use MetaMask as your wallet and Web3 provider. If you have not done so already, add the testnet to MetaMask and fund your wallet with testnet tokens using the [faucet](http://faucet.mamba.atago/).

- [Create or import an account with MetaMask.](basics/metamask)

## Step 1 - Configure Remix

- Visit the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). The left-hand side has a menu [1] and a typical file explorer [2]. The ` Solidity Compiler` [3] and `Deploy and Run Transactions` [4] plugins should be active by default.

![remix-menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/200480707-ec8b8e69-6cdc-498b-b315-c029fbc2a564.png)

If the solidity compiler and deploy plugins are not activated, then you can search and activate them using the plugin manager [5] located in the bottom-left of the screen.

![remix-plugin]Open MetaMask and double-check the sidechain testnet is the selected network. This will ensure Remix connects to the correct network when you configure your environment in the next step.

![meta-mask-atago](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/200482306-af1c0f4d-9ecf-4078-b0a3-a411306d13d1.png)

- In Remix, select the `Deploy & run transactions` plugin [1]. Since you are using MetaMask as your Web3 provider, select "Injected Provider" in the environment settings 2].

![environment-remix]To double-check that Remix is using the correct network, open MetaMask and confirm the network ID (78) and account match.

![double-check-remix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/200485405-0794ae10-95fd-4325-87e0-173ba4c2da1e.png)

## Step 2 - The Smart Contract

With Remix configured to the sidechain testnet, you can move onto your smart contract development and deployment.

- In the Remix file explorer, create an `erc20.sol` file in the `contracts/` directory and input the following Solidity statements:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";


/**
* @title {Mintable ERC20 Token}
*/
contract MintableERC20 is ERC20("Mintable Token", "MT"), Ownable {
    /** 
    * @dev See (ERC20 - _mint) function for details.
    *
    */
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external payable onlyOwner() {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

This smart contract describes a mintable ERC20 token using the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract libraries.

## Step 3 - Compile & Deploy

- Using the `Solidity compiler` plugin [1], select to "compile" the smart contract [2].

When the contract is compiled, you can view contract ABI, Bytecode, and more information located in "Compilation Details" [3].

![compile-remix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/200576656-dad4c35d-02f7-40ce-8bd1-3e9f8497e302.png)

- Now, select the `Deploy & run transactions` plugin > select "Deploy" [1] and confirm any MetaMask prompts to sign the transaction. If the deployment is successful, then the Remix console should return a green checkmark with expendable details [2]. The "Deployed Contracts" panel will contain the contract address and generates a contract interface to test functions [3].

![deploy-remix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/201174327-6be015b2-9003-4f3c-8d70-f376dd1a3a9a.png)

To verify the smart contract was deployed on the sidechain testnet you can:

- Search the transaction hash or contract address on the EVM sidechain testnet explorer [here](http://explorer.mamba.atago/).
- Open MetaMask and see if the contract deployment transaction was successfully signed.
- Check Remix logs for deployment details.
  
# HardHat
Install the following dependencies to set up a Hardhat development environment:

- [Node.js v10](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/)

Check Node.js and NPM is installed:

```
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

Hardhat is used through a local npm project installation. If you don't yet have an npm project, then simply initialize a new one and install Hardhat:

```
$ mkdir MyProject && cd MyProject # Create and enter into new project
$ npm init # initialize npm project
$ npm install --save-dev hardhat # install hardhat within the project
```

To create your Hardhat project, run `npx hardhat` in your project folder. If this is a new Hardhat project simply select to *Create a sample project*:

```
$ npx hardhat
888    888                      888 888               888

## Configure Hardhat for EVM sidechains testnet

To configure Hardhat to target the EVM Sidechains testnet, we need to:

- Add EVM Sidechains network [details](/network/network-details).
- Add an account private-key which will sign transactions and has `test FUEL` funds to pay for gas.
  - Setup an account with MetaMask [here](/basics/metamask).
  - Request `test FUEL` from the [Atago faucet](http://faucet-web.mamba.atago).

Take a look at the Hardhat configuration file (`hardhat.config.js`):

```
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

// This is a sample Hardhat task. To learn how to create your own go to
// https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
  const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  for (const account of accounts) {
    console.log(account.address);
  }
});

// You need to export an object to set up your config
// Go to https://hardhat.org/config/ to learn more

/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
};
```

Replace the content of the config file with the following content and replace `INSERT_PRIV_KEY` with your private key:

```
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */

const Private_Key = "INSERT_PRIV_KEY"

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.0",
  networks: {
  	atago: {
  		url: `http://faucet.mamba.atago/`,
  		accounts: [`0x${Private_Key}`]
  	}
  }
};
```

## Compile Contracts

```
$ npx hardhat compile
```

## Deploying to the example EVM sidechain testnet

Deploying with Hardhat utilizes deployment scripts located in `scripts/`. To deploy with Hardhat, execute the script with `atago` as the network option.

```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js --network atago
Greeter deployed to: 0x95E1C8F6C00d8cB518faBA33c8Ae814fc12E3090
```

üéâ Hurray! You're deployed to Atago, the example EVM sidechain testnet, and can search your deployment on the [testnet explorer]( http://explorer.mamba.atago/) 
   
# Truffle

Install the following dependencies to set up a Truffle development environment:

- [Node.js v8](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/)

Check Node.js and NPM are installed:

```
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

Install Truffle and check Truffle is installed:

```
$ npm install -g truffle
$ truffle version
Truffle v5.4.32 (core: 5.4.32)
Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)
Node v14.18.2
Web3.js v1.5.3
```

## Truffle Config

Update the Truffle configuration file with Atago credentials. Atago is the name of the example EVM sidechain testnet.

```
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
	atago: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://atago-passive-0.pilz.iohkdev.io/`),
      port: 9001,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
  },
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "^0.8.0"
    }
  }
};
```

## Deploying to Atago

Add gas to your wallet using the [Atago faucet](http://faucet-web.mamba.atago).
Finally, deploy your contract by executing `truffle migrate --network atago`.

```
$ truffle migrate --network atago
```

üéâ At this point you're deployed and can view your deployment on the [testnet explorer]( http://explorer.mamba.atago/)

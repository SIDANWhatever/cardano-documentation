The Cardano sidechains toolkit supports three development environments
- [Remix](#remix)
- [Hardhat](#hardhat)
- [Truffle](#truffle)

# Remix

[Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online IDE to develop and deploy Solidity smart contracts.

- Active` Solidity Compiler` and `Deploy and Run Transactions` modules.

![ice_screenshot_20220301-021718](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/156122744-7e5ef05e-6154-47f5-9e4b-5fa978854d94.png)

## The smart contract

- Create a new Solidity file in the contracts folder. For this example, we'll use `hello_world.sol`.

![ice_screenshot_20220302-020712](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/156312331-9e3be3ea-a518-4e9a-91cf-1f33a373cbdd.png)

- Simply copy the contents of this example contract below into `hello_world.sol`.

```
// Specifies the version of Solidity, using semantic versioning.
// Learn more: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/layout-of-source-files.html#pragma
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

// Defines a contract named `HelloWorld`.
// A contract is a collection of functions and data (its state). Once deployed, a contract resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. Learn more: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/structure-of-a-contract.html
contract HelloWorld {

   // Declares a state variable `message` of type `string`.
   // State variables are variables whose values are permanently stored in contract storage. The keyword `public` makes variables accessible from outside a contract and creates a function that other contracts or clients can call to access the value.
   string public message;

   // Similar to many class-based object-oriented languages, a constructor is a special function that is only executed upon contract creation.
   // Constructors are used to initialize the contract's data. Learn more: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/contracts.html#constructors
   constructor(string memory initMessage) {

      // Accepts a string argument `initMessage` and sets the value into the contract's `message` storage variable).
      message = initMessage;
   }

   // A public function that accepts a string argument and updates the `message` storage variable.
   function update(string memory newMessage) public {
      message = newMessage;
   }
}
```

### Compile contract

After writing the Solidity contract, it's time to compile.

- Using the Solidity compiler module, select to compile the smart contract.

![ice_screenshot_20220302-021438](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/156313057-d0c9719c-59fd-43be-b4f3-8260e6533123.png)

When the Solidity contract is compiled, Remix will generate the contract ABI, Bytecode, and other information which can be displayed by selecting Compilation Details.

### Deploy contract

- Deploying the smart contract through Remix requires a Web3 wallet configured to the appropriate target network. In our case, we want to deploy on Atago testnet. See how to setup a MetaMask wallet for Atago testnet [here](https://distracted-edison-a14746.netlify.app/basics/metamask).
- Fund your testnet account by requesting 1 Atago testnet tokens from the [Atago faucet](http://faucet-web.mamba.atago).
- In the Remix IDE, select the "Deploy & run transactions" module > configure to "Injected Web3" enviorment > Follow MetaMask wallet prompts > and finally "Deploy":

### Verify contract

There are a few ways to verify the smart contract deployment.

- Check the Remix logs panel and expand transaction details.
- Check MetaMask and see the transaction details.
- Search the transaction hash on the Atago testnet [block explorer](http://explorer.mamba.atago/).

# HardHat
Install the following dependencies to setup a Hardhat development environment:

- [Node.js v10](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/)

Check Node.js and NPM is installed:

```
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

Hardhat is used through a local npm project installation. If you don't yet have an npm project, then simply initialize a new one and install Hardhat:

```
$ mkdir MyProject && cd MyProject # Create and enter into new project
$ npm init # initialize npm project
$ npm install --save-dev hardhat # install hardhat within the project
```

To create your Hardhat project, run `npx hardhat` in your project folder. If this is a new Hardhat project simply select to *Create a sample project*:

```
$ npx hardhat
888    888                      888 888               888

## Configure Hardhat for EVM sidechains testnet

To configure Hardhat to target the EVM Sidechains testnet, we need to:

- Add EVM Sidechains network [details](/network/network-details).
- Add an account private-key which will sign transactions and has `test FUEL` funds to pay for gas.
  - Setup an account with MetaMask [here](/basics/metamask).
  - Request `test FUEL` from the [Atago faucet](http://faucet-web.mamba.atago).

Take a look at the Hardhat configuration file (`hardhat.config.js`):

```
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

// This is a sample Hardhat task. To learn how to create your own go to
// https://hardhat.org/guides/create-task.html
task("accounts", "Prints the list of accounts", async (taskArgs, hre) => {
  const accounts = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  for (const account of accounts) {
    console.log(account.address);
  }
});

// You need to export an object to set up your config
// Go to https://hardhat.org/config/ to learn more

/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
};
```

Replace the content of the config file with the following content and replace `INSERT_PRIV_KEY` with your private key:

```
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */

const Private_Key = "INSERT_PRIV_KEY"

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.0",
  networks: {
  	atago: {
  		url: `http://faucet.mamba.atago/`,
  		accounts: [`0x${Private_Key}`]
  	}
  }
};
```

## Compile Contracts

```
$ npx hardhat compile
```

## Deploying to the Cardano EVM sidechain testnet

Deploying with Hardhat utilizes deployment scripts located in `scripts/`. To deploy with Hardhat, execute the script with `atago` as the network option.

```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js --network atago
Greeter deployed to: 0x95E1C8F6C00d8cB518faBA33c8Ae814fc12E3090
```

üéâ Hurray! You're deployed to Atago, the Cardano EVM sidechain testnet, and can search your deployment on the [testnet explorer]( http://explorer.mamba.atago/)  
# Truffle
Install the following dependencies to setup a Truffle development environment:

- [Node.js v8](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/)

Check Node.js and NPM are installed:

```
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

Install Truffle and check Truffle is installed:

```
$ npm install -g truffle
$ truffle version
Truffle v5.4.32 (core: 5.4.32)
Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)
Node v14.18.2
Web3.js v1.5.3
```

## Truffle Config

Update the Truffle configuration file with Atago credentials. Atago is the name of the Cardano EVM sidechain testnet.

```
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
	atago: {
      provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://atago-passive-0.pilz.iohkdev.io/`),
      port: 9001,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    },
  },
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "^0.8.0"
    }
  }
};
```

## Deploying to Atago

Add gas to your wallet using the [Atago faucet](http://faucet-web.mamba.atago).
Finally, deploy your contract by executing `truffle migrate --network atago`.

```
$ truffle migrate --network atago
```

üéâ At this point you're deployed and can view your deployment on the [testnet explorer]( http://explorer.mamba.atago/)
